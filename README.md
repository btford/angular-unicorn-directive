# Angular Unicorn Directive
[Homepage](http://btford.github.com/angular-unicorn-directive/)

Do you ever get depressed at how few unicorns there are in your AngularJS app? I certainly do. But worry no more, dear friend. With this directive, adding a unicorn to your app has never been easier.

## Usage
1. Include `unicorn.js`.
2. Add `unicorn-directive` as a dependency to your app.
3. Make `<unicorn>`s.

## Bower
Installable via `bower`:

```bash
bower install angular-unicorn-directive
```

## Example
See the [homepage](http://btford.github.com/angular-unicorn-directive/) for an example.

```html
<div ng-app="unicorn-directive">
  <unicorn></unicorn>
  <p>^ This is a unicorn</p>
</div>
</pre>
```
